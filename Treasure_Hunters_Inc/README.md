### *Purpose*
The purpose of this project is to show how reinforcement learning algorithms can be used to train an agent to solve environments without any prior information.


### *Reinforcement Leanring Implementation*
The reinforcement learning algorithm used was the q-learning algorithm. Q-learning is the most popular reinforcement algortithm to use due to its simplistic nature.
