### *Purpose*
The purpose of this project is to show how reinforcement learning algorithms can be used to train an agent to solve environments without any prior information. In this particular project, the agent will be traversing a maze in order to find a treasure chest. However, there are various obstacles scattered throughout the maze, including snakes, pits, and quicksand traps.


### *Reinforcement Learning Implementation*
The reinforcement learning algorithm used was the q-learning algorithm. Q-learning is the most popular reinforcement algorithm used due to its simplistic nature. The algorithm is given by the equation.
