# Says One Neuron To Another
## By Ronald Moore and Austin Adams
  
### *Purpose*
The purpose of this project is to show how machine learning algorithms can be used to model distributions on features within the dataset.

### *Data*
The datasets used for this project can be located in the 'Data' subfolder of this repository
#### Zoo Dataset
The zoo classification dataset looks at the features of different animals and their given animal classes (mammal, bird, reptile, fish, amphibian, bug and invertebrate)

Some interesting features include:
* hair
* feathers
* eggs
* milk
* fins
* legs
* tail
#### Mushrmoom Dataset
The mushroom classification dataset looks at different features of both poisonous (p) and edible (e) mushrooms

Some interesting features include:
* cap shape
* cap surface
* bruises
* odor
* ring number
* ring type
* gill color

### *Neural Network Implementation*
*Detail about Neural nets (MLPs)*

### *Discussion*
* Activation Functions used for hidden layers and output layers
* Number of Layers used
