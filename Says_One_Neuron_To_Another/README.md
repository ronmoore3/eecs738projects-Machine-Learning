# Says One Neuron To Another
## By Ronald Moore and Austin Adams
  
### *Purpose*
The purpose of this project is to show how machine learning algorithms can be used to model distributions on features within the dataset.

### *Data*
The datasets used for this project can be located in the 'Data' subfolder of this repository
#### Dataset 1
Dataset 1 looks at blah blah blah \
Some interesting features include:
* feature 1
* feature 2
* etc
#### Dataset 2
Dataset 2 looks at blah blah blah \
Some interesting features include:
* feature 1
* feature 2
* etc

### *Neural Network Implementation*
*Detail about Neural nets (MLPs)*

### *Discussion*
* Activation Functions used for hidden layers and output layers
* Number of Layers used
